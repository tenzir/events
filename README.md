This repository contains slides and examples from events that we attended.

## Zeek Workshop Europe - Apr 2019

At the [Zeek Workshop Europe](https://indico.cern.ch/event/762505/) at CERN,
we showed how to bring together [MISP](http://www.misp-project.org) and
[Zeek](https://www.zeek.org). This presentation was a joint talk with Liviu
VÃ¢lsan (@liviuvalsan) who explained how to use this prototype operationally at
the CERN SOC. Our *robo investigator* expands on our approach that we
presented two months earlier (see below). In addition to correlating historical
sightings, *robo* now also interfaces with Zeek to propagate changes to intel
in real time and report "noisy" intel items.

## DFN Conference on Security in Networked Systems - Feb 2019

At this year's [DFN conference on Security in Networked
Systems](https://www.dfn-cert.de/veranstaltungen/sicherheitskonferenz2019.html),
we gave a demo on how to perform live correlation of threat intelligence with
historical data. Concretely, we showed how to tap into
[MISP](http://www.misp-project.org) feeds in real time and translate new
indicators into queries over old data. Our tool reports hits in historical data
back to MISP as *sightings*. This makes it possible to understand whether an
organization has been breached even before the indicator became available.

## BroCon - Oct 2018

At [BroCon 2018](https://www.brocon18.com) we talked about automated analysis
with [Broker](https://github.com/bro/broker). We used the example of automatic
historic intelligence lookups with [VAST](https://github.com/vast-io/vast) to
illustrate the Broker API. Additionally, we performed a performance analysis of
Broker in terms of throughput and latency.

Broker & Bro code:

- Python stubs: [Bro](brocon18/stub-bro), [VAST](brocon18/stub-vast)
- [Bro script](brocon18/vast.bro)
- [`bro-vast`](https://github.com/tenzir/bro-vast) package

See the [brocon18](brocon18) directory for the complete list of accompanying
material.
