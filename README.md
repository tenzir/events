## BroCon 2018

At [BroCon 2018](https://www.brocon18.com) we presented a talk about
[Broker](https://github.com/bro/broker). We used the example of automatic
historic intelligence lookups with [VAST](https://github.com/vast-io/vast) to
illustrate the Broker API. Additionally, we performed a performance analysis of
Broker in terms of throughput and latency.

The [brocon18](brocon18) sub directory contains all accompanying material.

- Python stubs: [Bro](brocon18/stub-bro), [VAST](brocon18/stub-vast)
- [Bro script](brocon18/vast.bro)
- [`bro-vast`](https://github.com/tenzir/bro-vast) package
